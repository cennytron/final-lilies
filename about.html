                <h3>Floral Scents</h3>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>Historically, floral scents have garnered significant attention. They surround us. Used in perfumes, food flavorings and cosmetics, they form an extremely important characteristic of ornamental plants (Fang et al, 2019). However, natural flower fragrance traits have been lost over time due to natural artificial selection (Dudareva and Pichersky, 2008). Issues with classical plant breeding can be mitigated through more detailed and widespread molecular genetic analysis (Dudareva and Pichersky, 2008). It has been utilized in other plants such as the petunia and snapdragon (Negre, F. et al, 2003). It is studies such as these that provide trail blazing models for investigating and synthesizing regulation of fragrance and how flowers are being artificially genetically modified. These studies are researching the genetic improvement of floral aroma composition through artificial genetic engineering processes and discovering the genes required in order to help this process. Roses were the first flowers to be classified based their aroma compounds. Similar classification studies have been conducted in other ornamental plants all with the aim of encouraging additional efforts to breed fragrent plants and ensure aroma types are not lost.</p>

                <h3>Background on Lilies</h3>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>The Lily is a familiar household ornamental flower. Within this species there are a vast array of diverse fragrant types. They range from weak scented cool scents strong scented woody aromas. This diversity makes this flower a rich biochemical and genetic resources for classification of aroma types (Johnson, T. S. et al, 2016). Despite this, only basic information about the floral scent compounds have been studied (Fang et al, 2019). There is lack of data into the Lilium aroma types, and broadly aroma causing phytochemical compounds (Fang et al, 2019). Little research has been done in order to classify these aroma types. Further research into the understanding of classification of biochemical compounds would be very useful in the process of selecting and breeding new varieties. Studies have found over 60 volatile compound in the lily cultivators and it is believe ed that the abundance of volatile molecules (and the differences in these volatiles) to create the difference between lilium fragrances (Hui-xiu et al, 2013). Interestingly, floral scent emissions occur in a circadian rhythm (Kong et al, 2012). This scent function particularizes their need to attract hawkmoths for pollination (Morinaga, 2008).</p>

                    <p>This study is a translation of the data from Volatile composition and classification of Lilium flower aroma types and identification, polymorphisms, and alternative splicing of their monoterpene synthase genes | Horticulture Research (nature.com). In this study, lily accessions were found to be classificed into six groups. These groups were determined by their major scent components of ‘faint-scented, cool, fruity, musky, fruity-honey, and lily’ (Fang et al, 2019). According to the study it will ‘provide a major resource for the assessment of lily scent volatiles and will be helpful in breeding of improved volatile components’ (Fang et al, 2019).</p>

                <h3>Data Sonification as a Translation Method</h3>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>The aim of this study was to represent chemical data in an alternate perceptive model (Boeve and Giot, 2021) through sonification. Data sonification can provide a secondary information source for multitasking, monitoring or new creative pattern spotting. This aims to explain the diversity of chemicals within the lilium species and how these contribute to different aromas. According to Rhea Braune et al, biological data sonification has the power to enhance discovery and has not been fully explored. It is a powerful tool of science communication, a new tool if discovery and can  enhance information accessibility (Braun et al, 2024). Sound is a natural information medium. It carries vast amounts of data which our ears process everyday without use even noticing. Despite decades of use by astronomers and particle physicists for complex tasks like pattern discovery (Diaz-Merced et al., 2012; Hughes, 2003) and science communication (Mohon, 2020; Zanella et al., 2022), the application of sonification in biological research has yet to be fully explored and harnessed. Applying an established method in new and unprecedent ways is exciting. It is a new method that will shed light on phytochemical diversity. Chemical diversity refers to the hierarchically structured complexity that integrates the physicochemical properties of molecules into species-specific profiles (Meinwald and Eisner, 1995). Phytochemical molecule interactions is complex and environment specific (there are an abundant amount of variables that impact these biochemical processes making it very difficult field to study). Sonification offers an alternate method of data translation, broadening the potential for insights.</p>

                <h3>Translating Smell</h3>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>Smell remains the most elusive of the senses and this is part of a growing schema of research whereby its chemical processes are bought to light (Wiltschko, 2019). Our olfactory sense plays a paramount role in how we analyze and react to the world around us. The way that humans perceive odor is defined by minuscule odorant molecules that interact with each other and form the basic formations of scents (Wilschko, 2019). In its simplest form, these odorant molecules are small building blocks and represent the simplest version of how odors can be phytochemically represented (Wiltschko, 2019). Given this importance, one would expect that the smell is considered at the forefront of technological advancement and digitsation. However, it is not. In the realm of artificial intelligence, this scent and its relative data have remained relatively silent.</p>
